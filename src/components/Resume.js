                  Hello there, <strong>I'm William.</strong>
                  <br/>
                  I'm a life-long musician with a B.S. in audio engineering.<br/>
                  My love of digital audio and data led me to pursue a career in software engineering and web development.<br/> 
                  I've learned that through hard work and perseverance, <br/> 
                  any goal can be achieved.
                </p>

                <h4>My Goal</h4>
                <p className="my-goal">
                  I aspire to <strong>design and build interactive and elegant web apps.</strong>
                  <br/> 
                  The desire to create something from nothing drives me to no end. <br/>
                  Picking the right tools for the job and learning by getting my hands dirty has proven to be the most effective way to improve my skills in development.
