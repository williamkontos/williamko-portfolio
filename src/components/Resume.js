                  Hello there, <strong style={ {color: 'white'} }>I'm William.</strong>
                  <br/>
                  I'm a life-long musician with a B.S. in audio engineering. 
                  My love of digital audio and data led me to pursue a career in software engineering and web development. 
                  I've learned that through hard work and perseverance, any goal can be achieved.
